<a href="http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017"> Lambda Days </a> took place during 8-9 February 2017 in Cracow. As Cracow is our home city we ofcourse couldn't stop ourselves from taking a part in this event.

## What are Lambda Days?

If you are asking yourself that question, you have been probably living under a rock or something. Jokes aside, Lambda Days is conference that happens anually and attracts a lot of functional programmers.

As organizers say:

> Lambda Days is a one of a kind experience in the functional world.
> Never-failing explosion of enthusiasm and talent is what gets us motivated to explore this amazing community in all of its potential.
> A journey we take through different ideas, technologies, paradigms and languages inspires creativity, growth and pure enjoyment of coding.

And it is totally true. There is no other place or  event where Scala, F# and Erlang/Elixir developers can cooexist peacefully.

## Keynotes

I have to say that variety of keynotes really overwhelmed me. From representation of positive integers (<a href="Why Functional Programming Matters"> Why functional programming matters</a> by John Hughes and Mary Sheeran) as functions and beautiful Haskel errors (a.k.a. several A4 pages of `t => t`) to representing stock prices as wall of penises. (Ain't joking here... <a href="https://twitter.com/BayaMoba/status/830094279133560832">Embodied Interactions </a>) Especially interesting was keynote titled `Build Good Software: Of Politics and Methods`. It was briefly describing destructive consequences of bad design and overcomplicating software. That's too bad that Java decelopers hadn't chance to see it...

I really think that John Hughes should have been awarded with title of attention thief. Each time when he was taking over the presentation I really was starting to pay attention. That was probably happening because of his gesticulation and voice modulation (high pitch accents on important and usually kind of funny elements).

## Building Systems of Tommorow

Were you aware of that in Germany there was developped a system to automatically send money to unemployed? Neither do I. And now I know why. Kind Ms. Txus Bach was talking about software development mess ups and how to prevent them. Because at the end no bug was made on purpose. Main core of his presentation was idea of how static typing can help us preventing such errors. He stated that tightening domain of your functions can help you prevent mistakes. And to be honest I can totally agree with him.

## \$\$\$  Elixr & Money \$\$\$

This talk presented by Tomasz Kowal thought me a lot about how to make resilient system. It could be easilly separated into several indpendent parts: cap db, let it crash and retrying. And ofcourse those are terms that more or less describe good system.

First part was treating about characterstics of ACID and BASE aproaches to data storage and differences between them. Although in the end Tomek shown yet another approach that I think is neither BASE or ACID. If you read `Domain Driven Design simply` you probably know that every solution should be adapted to domain of the problem. Same applies for bancing and accounting. No one considers bank accounts as simples fields that are mutated. Go ahead and log in to your bank account. What do you see? Balance and list of transactions! And the list of transactions is the key here. You balance account is actually seen by most of systems as a reduction of events. By the way that's an essence of event sourcing.

Apart from storing data properly each banking system should be fault tolerant. He made me finally realize what let it crash is in the essence. Let's consider you're flying a plane. Would you want to be flying a plane which software is written in `Let it crash` ideology? After few minutes of thinking you would probably realize that it's far more safe than flying a plane with several redundancy layers. If something fails it will just restart and keep going. It's far more optimistic than flying a plane that can suffer from `blue screen of death`...

If you want to get more details about it, just whatch the talk when it will be on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ErlangSolutions"> Erlang Solutions</a> youtube channel.
