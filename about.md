I have no idea why on earth would want to know anything about me, but if you really insist...

I've been programming for quite some time. I've used many popular languages sucha as C++, C# and Java, but they didn't convinced me. After only few weeks I was tired of omnipresent boilerplate... And then Chriss told me about Martin Odersky's child, Scala. It was a bit better, far more powerfull but inredibly annoying in the long run.

Few months later he told me about Elixir, brand new language with ugly do end syntax that supposed to be amazing. And it indeed was. Elixir had things that scala was lacking. It had simplicity and underlying powerfull VM with all of the Erlang legacy. 

That's where I'm now. I am very happy Elixir developer wannabe. Phoenix WebFramework completely blew me away with it's simple, yet powerfull design. If I could tell you to learn one single thing, I would tell you to learn Phoenix...
